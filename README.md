## STADIUM SEATING

There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write C++ program using modular that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.

## SOFTWARE SALES

A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:

| Quantity | Discount |
|:---|---:|
| 10–19 | 20% |
| 20–49 | 30% |
| 50–99 | 40% |
| 100 or more | 50% |

Design a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the total amount of the purchase after the discount.

## PENNIES FOR PAY

Design a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing what the
salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies.

## CHARGE ACCOUNT VALIDATION

Design a program that asks the user to enter a charge account number. The program should determine whether the number is valid by comparing it to the following list of valid charge account
numbers:

5658845, 4520125, 7895122, 8777541, 8451277, 1302850, 8080152, 4562555, 5552012, 5050552, 7825877, 1250255, 1005231, 6545231, 3852085, 7576651, 7881200, 4581002

These numbers should be stored in an array. Use the sequential search algorithm to locate the number entered by the user. If the number is in the array, the program should display a message indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the array, the program should display a message indicating the number is invalid.

## BUDGET ANALYSIS
Write C++  program that asks the user to enter the amount that he / she has budgeted for a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his / her expenses for the month, and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or under budget.
