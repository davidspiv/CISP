## Sum of Numbers
Assume that a file containing a series of integers is named numbers.dat and exists on the computer’s disk. Write C++  program that reads all of the numbers stored in the file and calculates their total. *hint*: To run the program, numbers.dat not exist ... you have to create it and save integer numbers in it, after this step you can read the numbers.

## Payroll Program with Input Validation
Write C++ payroll program that prompts the user to enter an employee’s hourly pay rate and the number of hours worked. Validate the user’s input so that only pay rates in the range of $7.50 through $18.25 and hours in the range of 0 through 40 are accepted. The program should display the employee’s gross pay.

## EXCHANGE RATE
Write a C++ program that converts US dollar to HKD dollar with a fix rate with 7.8. The program should ask user enter how many HKD and the program will convert it for the rate 7.8 into US dollar.

## Odd/Even Counter
Design C++ program that generates 100 random numbers, and keeps a count of how many of those random numbers are even and how many are odd.

## Rainfall Statistics
Design C++ program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into an array. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest amounts.


## SEARCH BENCHMARKS
Design an application that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a module that uses the sequential search algorithm to locate one of the values. The module should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. Then the program should call another module that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It should also keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on the screen.

## SORTING BENCHMARKS
Modify the modules presented in this chapter that perform the bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort algorithms on an Integer array, such that each module keeps a count of the number of swaps it makes. Then, design an application that uses three identical arrays of at least 20 integers. It should call each module on a different array, and display the number of swaps made by each algorithm.

## STADIUM SEATING
There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats cost $15, Class B seats cost $12, and Class C seats cost $9. Write C++ program using modular that asks how many tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the amount of income generated from ticket sales.

## SOFTWARE SALES
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:

| Quantity | Discount |
|:---|---:|
| 10–19 | 20% |
| 20–49 | 30% |
| 50–99 | 40% |
| 100 or more | 50% |

Design a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased. The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the total amount of the purchase after the discount.

## PENNIES FOR PAY
Design a program that calculates the amount of money a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day, two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing what the
salary was for each day, and then show the total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount, not the number of pennies.

## CHARGE ACCOUNT VALIDATION
Design a program that asks the user to enter a charge account number. The program should determine whether the number is valid by comparing it to the following list of valid charge account
numbers:

5658845, 4520125, 7895122, 8777541, 8451277, 1302850, 8080152, 4562555, 5552012, 5050552, 7825877, 1250255, 1005231, 6545231, 3852085, 7576651, 7881200, 4581002

These numbers should be stored in an array. Use the sequential search algorithm to locate the number entered by the user. If the number is in the array, the program should display a message indicating the number is valid. If the number is not in the array, the program should display a message indicating the number is invalid.

## BUDGET ANALYSIS
Write C++  program that asks the user to enter the amount that he / she has budgeted for a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his / her expenses for the month, and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or under budget.
